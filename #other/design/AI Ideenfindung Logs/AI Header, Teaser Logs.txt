I'm working on a website and need Ideas for the main header and teaser-text for my starter frontpage.

some context how the website will be like:
hero 100vh, sliders min-height 100vh
page 1 - starting page

hero
header-teaser 1/2 page
3 other pages tabs flex-row, with header and teaser for each 1/2 page

page 2 - planet earth

hero - not sure
image-slider, earth-maps-slider
text-facts


page 3 - solar system

hero - solar system animation (hover on planet highlight and display planets name)
text-facts img-slider
img-slider text-facts
text-facts img-slider
...


page 4 - interstellar

hero - big bang animation
animation-slider mit text-facts (text-scroll on overflow)
Absolutely! Here are some ideas for your website's main header, teaser text, and overall structure, tailored to the space theme you have going:

Page 1 - Starting Page

Hero Header: "Explore the Wonders of the Cosmos"
Hero Teaser: "Embark on a journey through space and time, where discovery awaits."
Tab 1: Planet Earth

Header: "Our Pale Blue Dot"
Teaser: "Uncover the secrets of the planet we call home."
Tab 2: Solar System

Header: "Our Stellar Neighborhood"
Teaser: "Journey through our cosmic backyard and witness the planets."
Tab 3: Interstellar

Header: "Beyond the Stars"
Teaser: "Delve into the mysteries of deep space, where galaxies and nebulae reside."
Page 2 - Planet Earth

Hero: You could consider a beautiful, high-resolution rotating image of Earth with a subtle zoom effect.
Page 3 - Solar System

Hero: Your interactive solar system animation sounds perfect!
Page 4 - Interstellar

Hero: Your Big Bang animation is a great start! Combine that with perhaps a subtle starfield that changes density as you scroll, adding a sense of movement through space.
Code Example (Simplified)

Here's a basic HTML structure to illustrate the header/teaser idea.  Of course, you'll want to add the necessary CSS for layout, styling, and responsiveness.

HTML
<div class="hero">
  <h1>Explore the Wonders of the Cosmos</h1>
  <p>Embark on a journey through space and time, where discovery awaits.</p>
</div>

<div class="tabs">
  <div class="tab">
     <h2>Our Pale Blue Dot</h2>
     <p>Uncover the secrets of the planet we call home.</p>
  </div> 
  <div class="tab">
     <h2>Our Stellar Neighborhood</h2>
     <p>Journey through our cosmic backyard and witness the planets.</p>
  </div>  
  <div class="tab">
     <h2>Beyond the Stars</h2>
     <p>Delve into the mysteries of deep space, where galaxies and nebulae reside.</p>
  </div> 
</div>
Use code with caution.
Additional Style Recommendations

Dark Backgrounds: The space theme lends itself naturally to dark backgrounds with contrasting bright colors for text.
High-Quality Images: Stunning images of space will capture the attention of your visitors.
Subtle Animations: Consider gentle animations to bring elements like starfields or planets to life. Avoid anything too distracting or flashy.
Let me know if you'd like more specific guidance on sliders or animations – I can even provide basic code examples to get you started!
