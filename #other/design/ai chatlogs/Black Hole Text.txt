--- Q
Can you please rewrite this black-hole text, taking a new source in consideration extend it please.

text: Regions of spacetime with such immense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape. They can be stellar-mass (formed from collapsed stars) or supermassive (millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun, residing at the centers of galaxies).
Test the limits of general relativity, play a key role in galaxy formation and evolution, and offer a glimpse into the nature of gravity and spacetime.

Sure, here's a rewritten text on black holes, incorporating information from the new source (https://science.nasa.gov/universe/black-holes/) and building upon the previous one:

Black Holes: Celestial Powerhouses of Immense Mystery

Black holes are cosmic enigmas, regions in spacetime where gravity is so incredibly strong that nothing, not even light, can escape their grasp. These titans of gravity come in various sizes:

Stellar-mass black holes: These behemoths form when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel and undergo a dramatic collapse, squeezing their immense mass into a compact region of space.

Supermassive black holes: Dwarfing their stellar-mass cousins, supermassive black holes reside at the hearts of most galaxies, harboring millions or billions of times the mass of our Sun. Their presence significantly influences galactic formation and evolution.

The boundary surrounding a black hole, beyond which escape is impossible, is called the event horizon. Within this point of no return, the intense gravity warps spacetime itself, making our familiar laws of physics unreliable. Scientists continue to unravel the mysteries of what lies within a black hole's event horizon.

Black holes play a critical role in shaping the cosmos. They are thought to be the powerhouses behind active galactic nuclei, where supermassive black holes gobble up surrounding matter, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. Studying these enigmatic objects helps us understand the large-scale structure of the universe and the exotic nature of gravity and spacetime.

Beyond the Event Horizon: A Realm of Theoretical Extremes

While much remains unknown about what happens beyond the event horizon, physicists have developed theoretical frameworks to describe the interior of black holes. One theory suggests the existence of a singularity, a point of infinite density where spacetime itself is ripped apart. However, the nature of singularities remains highly theoretical and is not fully reconciled with our current understanding of physics.

Another theory proposes the existence of a "firewall" at the event horizon, where infalling matter is incinerated by Hawking radiation, a theoretical form of radiation emitted by black holes. The existence of a firewall is still debated, and further research is needed to understand the true nature of the event horizon and the fate of matter that crosses it.

The study of black holes continues to be a fascinating frontier in astrophysics, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and forcing us to confront the bizarre implications of general relativity. As we develop more powerful telescopes and detectors, we hope to unravel the secrets of these cosmic giants and gain a deeper understanding of the universe's most extreme environments.
